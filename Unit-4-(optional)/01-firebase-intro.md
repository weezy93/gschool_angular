#Firebase Intro

This unit focuses on writing Angular apps with a backend.  Rather than starting with Rails or Express, we're going to use a simple and powerful service called Firebase as our backend.

**Firebase lets you write an application without writing any server side code.** Firebase is your database and server in one, plus web sockets for real time functionality.

> “We’ve kind of changed the paradigm from one were you think about sending data and storing data as two separate things to a paradigm where it’s just about synchronizing data.

> Firebase doesn’t just move information from one client to another. It shuttles all client communications to a central data repository in the proverbial cloud. If multiple people are text chatting, for instance, Firebase doesn’t just send text between the clients. It sends all text to a repository that all clients tap into. When one client updates the repository, the changes are synchronized across all other clients.” - Andrew Lee, cofounder of Firebase
