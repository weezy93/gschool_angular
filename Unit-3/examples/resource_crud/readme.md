# CRUD with NgResource

This simple application uses MongoDB and ngResource to create a very simple interface for a fullstack CRUD application. 

## Setup

```
npm install
```

Additionally, you'll need an instance of mongodb running:

```
mongod
```

If you don't have Mongo installed you can get up and running fast enough:

```
brew install mongodb
mkdir -p /data/db
mongod
```

## Run it

```
npm start
```
