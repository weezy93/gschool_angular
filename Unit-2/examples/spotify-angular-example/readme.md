# Spotify Front End With Angular

This example of the `$http` service is based on assignments and examples you may have seen in some form or another already:

[Spotify API w/ JQuery](https://github.com/gSchool/spotify-albums-and-tracks)

[Spotify API as an Express App](https://github.com/gSchool/spotify-albums-and-tracks-server-side-remix)

[Spotify in the CLI with Node.js and Promises](https://github.com/gSchool/spotify-promises-example)

This is another way to get similar behavior - search for an artist on spotify -> display all the artists matching that search. Upon clicking on an artist display each of the artists albums, with their track list and release date. 

## Run the Example

In your terminal, simply:

```
open index.html
```

Or copy the filepath into your browser's url bar.
